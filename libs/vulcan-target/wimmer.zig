//! Shared, target-independent Wimmer-Franz register allocator (Wimmer & Franz, CGO 2010).
//! This module owns the ALGORITHM. Each backend owns ENCODING and supplies a `RegDescription`
//! that describes its register model to the allocator.
//!
//! Physical registers are an ABSTRACTION here. The allocator only ever sees a `u16` register
//! INDEX within a class. The backend picks a stable numbering and maps the index back to its
//! own register enum. See each backend's `*RegDescription` for the numbering it picked. For
//! example, aarch64 uses the register's own enum integer value. So gpr class index n names x_n,
//! and fpr class index n names v_n.
//!
//! A value normally occupies ONE register. A backend that supplies `RegDescription.regWidth` may
//! give a value a span of N CONSECUTIVE registers under an alignment, which is what an NVIDIA 64-bit
//! address pair needs. `Location.reg` then names the BASE of the span, and every place the allocator
//! picks, blocks, or compares a register works over the whole span. See `RegWidth`.

// ===========================================================================
// SPILL-SLOT COALESCING. The scan hands every spilled interval its own fresh
// slot, so a spilled block parameter and the spilled argument that feeds it
// land on DIFFERENT slots. The edge move for the pair is then a slot-to-slot
// copy, `ldr scratch,[arg_slot]; str scratch,[param_slot]`, two memory ops per
// phi per in-edge. In a high-pressure function with many spilled loop-carried
// phis this dominates the memory traffic. Giving the parameter and its argument
// ONE slot makes the edge move same-slot, and the edge resolver drops a
// same-location move, so the copy vanishes. This mirrors what a graph-coloring
// allocator gets from phi coalescing, extended onto the stack.
//
// Two soundness properties are enforced:
//   1. INTERFERENCE: two values that are simultaneously live never share a
//      slot. A union is rejected unless every interval on one slot is disjoint
//      from every interval on the other. A loop phi and its own back-edge
//      argument, which overlap in the loop body, are correctly NOT coalesced.
//   2. PARALLEL-MOVE PRECONDITION: `orderClassMoves` relies on no spill slot
//      being both a source and a destination on one edge (its cycle-break
//      routes only registers through the scratch). After coalescing this is
//      re-verified over every edge's full move set; if any edge would break it,
//      the WHOLE coalescing is dropped and the byte-identical distinct-slot
//      placement stands.
// Both checks run under the same numbering the scan and resolver use, so the
// coalesced placement is exactly what `buildAllocation` and `resolveDataFlow`
// then consume, with the redundant same-slot moves naturally absent.

///
///  1. `current` is a split child. The value then has an EARLIER piece, so it already occupies a
///     location at `u` that the early store can read. Without one the value is DEFINED at `u` and
///     nothing is in memory yet to store.
///  2. `current.end() > u + 1`. There must be room for both halves. An interval that is already one
///     position wide and still cannot hold a register is the genuinely unsatisfiable case.
///  3. No `must_have_register` use sits at `u + 1`, which is where the remainder starts. The
///     remainder must not need a register at its own start, or the move that gives it one lands
///     behind the clobber and reads the destroyed register.
///  4. `u + 1` is not a block-entry position. The transition must stay inside one block. A
///     block-entry transition is an edge move resolution emits, and the value would then be stored
///     twice.
///
/// Precondition 4 tests `u + 1`, but the position resolution classifies is the START of the
/// remainder. The two are the same position unless `current` has a hole immediately after `u`. In
/// the hole shape the remainder starts at the next range, and every range after an interval's first
/// range starts at a block-entry row. Resolution then DOES emit an edge move for the same transition
/// the early store made, and the value goes to memory twice. That result is still correct, for a
/// reason liveness gives. The hole says the value is not live-out of the block that holds `u`. The
/// block the remainder starts at has the value live-in, so the value is live-out of every
/// predecessor of that block. If that block were reachable from the block that holds `u`, then the
/// value would be live-out of the block that holds `u` too, and the liveness passes would have
/// filled the hole. So the two stores sit on paths that never meet, and the store at `u` is dead but
/// harmless. `coalesceSpillSlots` holds the slot over the whole prefix `[store_at, start())`, so no

// sides of a control-flow edge. The splitter placed it in a register in one
// block and a slot in another, or a block parameter simply lands in a different
// register than the argument that feeds it. Each such difference becomes a MOVE
// on that edge. The raw move set of one edge may contain conflicts, where one
// move's destination is another's source, and cycles, a register swap. So each
// edge's moves are ordered into a valid sequence. Every source is read before
// it is overwritten, cycles are broken through the class scratch register, and
// a slot-to-slot shuffle is routed through the class scratch too, since no
// target moves memory to memory in one op. The backend emits the ordered list
// op by op with no further reordering.

// an edge, and a critical edge, a multi-successor `if` block feeding a
// multi-predecessor block, has no block that can host them without corrupting

// The debug verifier (VERIFYINTERVALS).
//
// A white-box checker that validates a COMPLETED allocation and runs inside
// `allocate` whenever `std.debug.runtime_safety` is on, in every test and
// debug build. So an allocation bug fails loudly at an assert instead of
// silently miscompiling. It never runs under ReleaseFast, so the production
// JIT keeps its speed. It operates on the final intervals, the originals AND
// the split children flattened into one slice, and checks three soundness
// properties:
//
//   1. REGISTER EXCLUSIVITY: no two same-class intervals whose register SPANS
//      overlap have overlapping live ranges. This is the core soundness
//      property. A value that occupies N consecutive registers is compared over
//      its whole span, not its base alone, so a two-register value sitting on
//      top of its neighbor is caught here.
//   2. MUST_HAVE_REGISTER: every `must_have_register` use is covered by a
//      register-located interval of its value, never only a spill slot.
//   3. ASSIGNMENT: every value interval with a use was placed somewhere.
//   4. SPAN LEGALITY: a placed interval's base register meets the alignment its
//      width demands, and its span fits the register-index space.
//   5. EARLY STORE: an interval with `store_at` reads a location that still
//      holds the value at that position, and owns its slot over the whole
//      prefix from the store to its own start. A reload-at-use split is the
//      only maker of such an interval, and it is the first thing that makes a
//      slot busy OUTSIDE the ranges of the interval that owns it. Slot
//      exclusivity was true by construction before spill-slot coalescing, and
//      the coalescer polices itself, so this is where the new obligation is
//      answered rather than argued.
//
// The two legitimate same-span overlaps, a value interval and its OWN
// entry-parameter fixed interval at entry, and a coalesced copy pair, are
// exempt from check 1. Both share a WHOLE span. A PARTIAL span overlap is never
// legitimate, so it stays a violation even for such a pair.
