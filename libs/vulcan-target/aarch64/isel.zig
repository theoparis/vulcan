//! AArch64 instruction selection. It lowers an IR function to A64 machine words.
//! It covers integer and float arithmetic (including divide, remainder, and shifts),
//! comparisons, select, the high-IR `if`, jumps with block-param edge moves,
//! return and call, NEON vectors, and stack memory.
//!
//! It uses linear-scan register allocation with spilling. Live intervals (from the
//! definition to the last use) are scanned in start order from a register pool. A
//! non-leaf function draws from the callee-saved x19 to x28 plus the caller-saved
//! temporaries x9 to x12. A leaf function draws from the caller-saved x9 to x12 and
//! its unused argument registers first, then, only under high pressure, from the same
//! callee-saved x19 to x28. When the pool runs out, a result spills to a stack slot.
//! Block parameters are never spilled. This keeps edge moves simple. A function opens
//! a frame when it makes a call (to save lr) or uses any callee-saved register (to
//! save it). Alloca and spill slots live above them.

// Wimmer bridge gap #7: a live-range split whose two adjacent segments are BOTH spill slots.
// `translateTransition` now builds a `.slot_to_slot` action instead of bailing `error.Unsupported`,
// and `emitSplitAction` expands it into reload-then-store through the class scratch.
//
// A NATURAL Wimmer allocation can never reach this shape on aarch64: `aarch64UseKind` makes EVERY
// operand use (including edge arguments) `must_have_register`, and `spillCurrent`'s only two call
// sites in `wimmer.zig`'s `allocateBlockedReg` either (a) split at a value's OWN next must-have use,
// which its next pop is then PROVEN to resolve into a register rather than a second self-spill
// (`current.firstUseAfter(current.start()) == current.start()` can never exceed any candidate's
// `next_use`, which is always `>= current.start()` too, so the "current is cheaper to spill" branch
// can never fire there), or (b) the "no evictable register" branch, which is only safe when
// `current.start()` is NOT itself a use (otherwise `spillCurrent`'s own
// `assert(u > current.start())` fires first, a separate PRE-EXISTING wimmer.zig limitation on
// same-position over-subscription, unrelated to this bridge gap). Empirically confirmed against two
// differential candidates (an asymmetric-use-gap pressure kernel, and a many-block-param loop
// header): the former always resolves reg -> slot -> reg, never slot -> slot, and the latter crashes
// the pre-existing over-subscription assert before ever reaching `translateAllocation`. So these tests
// exercise the exact mechanism (`emitSplitAction`'s `.slot_to_slot` arm) directly with a hand-built
// `SplitAction`, the same way the file's other low-level tests check exact encoded words rather than
// routing through a full differential compile.
