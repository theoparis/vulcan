//! The 64-bit address carry chain, proved on the silicon.
//!
//! A global pointer lives in a GPR PAIR, so `ptr + offset` is two instructions:
//! an `IADD3` that adds the low halves and writes a carry-out predicate, then an
//! `IADD3.X` that adds the high halves and READS that predicate. The `.X` flag
//! is bit 74 of the second instruction, and it is the only thing that makes the
//! hardware look at the carry at all. Without it the pair still assembles, still
//! disassembles as two plain adds, and computes an address 4 GiB too low
//! whenever the low halves overflow.
//!
//! Every other pointer test in this repository uses buffers whose low halves
//! never overflow, so all of them pass with the carry dropped. This file exists
//! to make the carry the ONLY difference between a right answer and a wrong one.
//!
//! ## How the address is arranged
//!
//! `compute.Runner` hands out GPU virtual addresses from a bump pointer, and
//! `next_va` is data, so a test can put a buffer where it wants one. Two buffers
//! are placed EXACTLY 4 GiB apart. The kernel then adds a base and an offset
//! whose low halves sum past 2^32:
//!
//!     base   0x0000_0002_FFF0_0000   (a bare address, never read or written)
//!     offset 0x0000_0000_FFF0_0000
//!     sum    0x0000_0003_FFE0_0000   with the carry, the HIGH buffer
//!     sum    0x0000_0002_FFE0_0000   without it, the LOW buffer
//!
//! Both outcomes are mapped memory, so a dropped carry writes the wrong buffer
//! instead of faulting the channel, and the test reports a value rather than a
//! timeout.
//!
//! ## The reserved address window
//!
//! The driver keeps a range of virtual addresses for itself. A mapping at
//! 0x1_0000_0000 is REFUSED outright, and a mapping anywhere else in the range is
//! accepted and then silently drops every store the GPU sends to it. No error, no
//! fault, the writes simply vanish.
//!
//! The nvidia.zig session measured the range more carefully than the first pass
//! here did, sweeping with a FRESH CHANNEL PER ADDRESS because a hung dispatch
//! poisons the channel and makes a shared-channel sweep report a false result.
//! Their figures, on a GB10: 0xFE00_0000 works, everything from 0xFF00_0000 up to
//! 0x1_FFF0_0000 swallows stores, and 0x2_0000_0000 works again. So the lower
//! bound is 0xFF00_0000, lower than the 0xFFE0_0000 this file first recorded, and
//! real code mapping at 0xFF00_0000 would have vanished.
//!
//! TREAT THE EXACT EDGES AS DRIVER AND PART DEPENDENT. That sweep ran on a GB10;
//! this machine is an RTX 5070. Both agree the window exists and that
//! 0x2_0000_0000 and above is safe, which is what the addresses below rely on.
//! Every address in this file sits well clear of it, which is why the pair is at
//! 0x2_FFE0_0000 and 0x3_FFE0_0000 rather than the more obvious 0xFFE0_0000.
//!
//! nvidia.zig now refuses the whole range in `rm.Client.mapToGpu` with
//! `error.ReservedGpuAddress`, so a consumer of that allocator is protected.
//!
//! ## Skipping
//!
//! `compute.Runner.init` gives `error.SkipZigTest` when no GPU answers, and
//! `gpu()` turns a permission error or a missing driver node into the same
//! result. A machine with no NVIDIA hardware skips every live test here. The
//! structural test at the end needs no GPU and always runs. A host that is not
//! Linux skips EARLIER, at `hasDriver`, because the transport would send Linux
//! syscalls to a kernel that does not know them.
