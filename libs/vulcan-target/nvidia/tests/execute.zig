//! NVIDIA hardware execution. Every other NVIDIA test in this repository reads the
//! STRUCTURE of the emitted instruction stream: opcode counts and decoded bit fields.
//! This one compiles a kernel with `isel.compileKernel`, uploads the SASS to a real
//! GPU through the nvidia.zig compute dispatch, runs it, reads the buffers back, and
//! compares the ACTUAL NUMBERS. It is the only test that proves the silicon agrees.
//!
//! ## The parameter base
//!
//! nvidia.zig binds the caller's parameter buffer as the BASE of constant bank 0, so
//! its kernels read parameters at offset 0. The CUDA driver instead puts a block of
//! its own in front, which is why `isel.nvidia_abi` uses 0x160. The two conventions
//! are both correct, and `Abi.param_base` is data for exactly this reason. Every
//! kernel here compiles under `runner_abi`, whose `param_base` is 0. A kernel built
//! with 0x160 and dispatched by this runner would read 352 bytes past its parameters,
//! and "the same kernel under both bases" below proves the base is honoured as data.
//!
//! ## Skipping
//!
//! `compute.Runner.init` gives `error.SkipZigTest` when no GPU answers, and `gpu()`
//! below turns a permission error or a missing driver node into the same result. A
//! machine with no NVIDIA hardware, such as CI, skips every test in this file. A host
//! that is not Linux skips EARLIER, at `hasDriver`, because the transport would send
//! Linux syscalls to a kernel that does not know them.
