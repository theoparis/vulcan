// riscv64 RegDescription for the shared Wimmer-Franz allocator (wimmer.zig).
//
// riscv64 has four register classes, versus aarch64's two:
//   class 0 "int"        (Reg,  8-byte slot)  index = @intFromEnum(Reg)  x0..x31
//   class 1 "float"      (FReg, 8-byte slot)  index = @intFromEnum(FReg) f0..f31
//   class 2 "vector"     (VReg, 16-byte slot) index = @intFromEnum(VReg) v0..v31  (RVV)
//   class 3 "vpu_vector" (FReg, 32-byte slot) index = @intFromEnum(FReg) f0..f31  (et-soc VPU)
//
// A per-function `vpu` bool (from caps.vpu) picks one of the two vector classes: RVV (class 2) when
// false, et-soc VPU (class 3) when true. So exactly one of class 2 or class 3 has a non-empty pool.
// vpu mode also narrows the scalar-float pool (class 1) to f0..f7, because the VPU has no separate
// vector file and instead partitions the shared FReg file (see the vpu note above `vpu_vector_regs`).
//
// Index-space overlap: class 1 and class 3 both index the FReg enum, so their register indices
// collide numerically (for example index 16 is f16 for either). They stay disjoint by pool, never by
// index. Class 1 draws from f0..f7 (vpu) or f0..f9/f18..f29 (non-vpu), class 3 draws from f16..f27, and
// the two are never both active in one function. The (class, index) pair is what disambiguates them, and
// the eventual translation maps a (class, index) back to the right FReg/VReg. This is only
// the description. No allocation runs here.
//
// This mirrors `aarch64RegDescription`'s shape and builds its content from the same pools/ABI/call
// logic the retired native linear scan used, now the sole allocation description for riscv64.

/// Backend context threaded through `classOf`/`useKind`. Unlike aarch64 (whose class decision needs

// `Action` (see `SplitAction`'s doc comment), so `walloc.actions` never carries one either. These
// tests exercise the exact mechanism (`emitSplitAction`'s `.slot_to_slot` arm) directly with a
